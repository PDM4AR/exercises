    Class for Implementing the Separate Axis Theorem

    ## To be added to the website.
    The Separating Axis Theorem states: If two sets are closed and at least one of them is compact, then there is a hyperplane between them,
    and even two parallel hyperplanes separated by a gap. An axis that is orthogonal to a separating hyperplane is deemed a separating axis, because
    the orthogonal projections of the convex bodies onto the axis are disjoint. 

    ## THEOREM
    Let A and B be two disjoint nonempty convex subsets of R^n. Then there exist a nonzero vector v anda  real number c s.t. 
    <x,v> >= c and <y,v> <= c. For all x in A and y in B. i.e. the hyperplane <.,v> = c separates A and B. 

    If both sets are clsoed, and at least one of them is compact, then the separation can be strict, that is, 
    <x,v> > c_1 and <y,v> < c_2 for some c_1 > c_2
    

    In this exercise, we will be implementing the Separating Axis Theorem for 2d Primitives.

    Axis are represented as Segments with length N (world length)
