## Exercise

Collision checking is a crucial capability of any planning system. 
In this exercise, you will implement a basic collision checking module for a circular shape differential drive robot. 
The goal is to obtain a module that can perform collision checks between basic geometric primitives. 
This can then be used for a given robot to check whether its candidate (sub-)paths are collision-free.

### Collision check primitives

We start off by implementing some collision check primitives for basic geometric shapes. 
These will come handy later on. 
The first step is to implement the functions inside the `CollisionPrimitives` class in `src/pdm4ar/exercises/ex06/collision_primitives.py` file.

In this section, we suggest to use linear algebra modules like `numpy`. 
But you are not allowed to use modules that implements collision check directly such as `shapely`.

#### Step 1: Point-Circle Collision Checking Procedure

In this step, you will implement a function that checks whether a point is inside the given circle or not.
To represent a point and circle, the following data structures (`src/pdm4ar/exercises_def/ex06/structures.py`) will be used:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point(GeoPrimitive):
    x: float
    y: float

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Circle(GeoPrimitive):
    center: Point
    radius: float
```

In this part, you will implement the `circle_point_collision` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Circle` *c*, and  a `Point` *p* as arguments. It return *True* if given `Point` is inside the `Circle`.

#### Step 2: Point-Triangle Collision Checking Procedure

In this step, you will implement a function that checks whether a point is inside the given triangle or not. 
You could find an explanation of this procedure [here](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/tri-point.php#:~:text=To%20test%20if%20a%20point,the%20corners%20of%20the%20triangle.). 
Please note that, you could use the procedure described [here](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/tri-point.php#:~:text=To%20test%20if%20a%20point,the%20corners%20of%20the%20triangle.), but you are free to use any algorithm. 
To represent the triangle, the following data structure (`src/pdm4ar/exercises_def/ex06/structures.py`) will be used:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Triangle(GeoPrimitive):
    v1: Point
    v2: Point
    v3: Point
```

In this part, you will implement the `triangle_point_collision` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Triangle` *t*, and  a `Point` *p* as arguments. 
It returns *True* if given `Point` is inside the `Triangle`.

#### Step 3: Point-Polygon Collision Checking Procedure

In this step, you will implement a function that checks whether a point is inside the given polygon or not. 
In this step, you could use triangulation to decompose a `Polygon` into a set of `Triangle`. 
For triangulation, `triangulate` function of the [triangle module](https://github.com/drufat/triangle) could be used. 
The documentation of this module is [here](https://rufat.be/triangle/). using the `triangle_point_collision` collision between a polygon and point will be detected. 
To represent the polygon, the following data structure (`src/pdm4ar/exercises_def/ex06/structures.py`) will be used:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Polygon(GeoPrimitive):
    vertices: List[Point]
```

In this part, you will implement the `polygon_point_collision` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Polygon` *poly*, and  a `Point` *p* as arguments. 
It returns *True* if given `Point` is inside the `Polygon`.

#### Step 4: Segment-Circle Collision Checking Procedure

In this step, you will implement a function that checks whether a segment collides with a circle or not. 
There is an explanation of the procedure [here](https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/line-circle.php). 
Please note that, you could use the procedure described [here](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/tri-point.php#:~:text=To%20test%20if%20a%20point,the%20corners%20of%20the%20triangle.), but you are free to use any algorithm. 
To represent the segment, the following data structure (`src/pdm4ar/exercises_def/ex06/structures.py`) will be used:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Segment:
    p1: Point
    p2: Point
```

In this part, you will implement the `circle_segment_collision` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Cricle` *c*, and  a `Segment` *s* as arguments. 
It returns *True* if given `Segment` collides with `Circle`.

#### Step 5: Segment-Triangle Collision Checking Procedure

In this step, you will implement a function that checks whether a segment collides with a triangle or not. 
The idea is to sample points on the segment and check whether they collide or not via the `triangle_point_collision` function.

In this part, you will implement the `triangle_segment_collision` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Triangle` *t*, and  a `Segment` *s* as arguments. 
It returns *True* if given `Segment` collides with `Triangle`.

#### Step 6: Segment-Polygon Collision Checking Procedure

In this step, you will implement a function that checks whether a segment collides with a polygon or not. 
The idea is to sample points on the segment and check whether they collide or not via the `polygon_point_collision` function.

In this part, you will implement the `polygon_segment_collision` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Polygon` *poly*, and  a `Segment` *s* as arguments. 
It returns *True* if given `Segment` collides with `Polygon`.

#### Step 7: Optimization via Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes

The execution time performance of the collision checker is quite important for an efficient planning module. 
In this step, the aim is to improve the execution time perfromance of the `polygon_segment_collision` primitive. 
We can achieve the same result by simply checking the points within the AABB. In this way, we can get rid of unnecessary collision checks. 
As a result, we aim to see the execution time difference between pure collision checking and collision checking with the optimization.

In this part, you will implement `polygon_line_collision_aabb` function of `CollisionPrimitives` class. 
This function takes a `Polygon` *poly*, and  a `Segment` *s* as arguments. 
It returns *True* if given `Segment` collides with `Polygon`. 
You are free to use or not to use `_poly_to_aabb` function to calculate `AABB`.

### Collision check module

In the second part of this exercise, we leverage the collision primitives just implemented to perform collision checking for our robot. 
Please note that, for the remaining part of this exercise, we will use a circular shaped differential drive robot. 
For this part of the exercise, you can assume that our robot will move inside a 2D world that contains fixed obstacles on a predefined path. 
The obstacles inside the world must be polygon-shaped, circular-shaped or triangular-shaped. 
For each of the following steps, you will implement different methods to check collisions for the possible path of our robot.

To represent the path of robot, the following data structure (`src/pdm4ar/exercises_def/ex06/structures.py`) will be used:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Path:
    waypoints: List[Point]
```

Please note that the definition of `Path` and `Polygons` are similar. 
`Polygon` class connects the first and last vertices by default. 
However, there is not any connection between first and last waypoints in `Path` objects. 
For the remaining part of the exeercise, you are free to use or modify `check_collision` function. 
This functions takes two `GeoPrimitives` and check the collision between them by using the primitives implemented in the first part of this exercise.

The task is to implement the functions in the `CollisionChecker` class in `src/pdm4ar/exercises/ex06/collision_checker.py`.

#### Step 8: Collision Checking Procedure for Circle-shaped Robot

In this step, you will implement a baseline version for collision checking by using the primitives implemented before. 
The aim of this part is to check if a candidate path for our circular robot is collision-free. 

You will implement `path_collision_check` function which returns the `Segment` indices of the given `Path` which are in collision with the given obstacles. 
This function takes a `Path` *t*, the radius of the robot's occupancy *r*, and a list of obstacles as arguments. 
It returns the list of indices which represents the `Segment`s of the `Path` which are in collision with any of the obstacles.

#### Step 9: Collision Checking via Occupancy Grid

The aim and all the assumptions are same as `Step 8`. 
However, in this step, you will use different approach for collision checking. 
You are asked to implement collision checking via occupancy grids. 
You will initially create an occupancy grid of the given environment. 
Then using the occupancy grid, you will find the segments of the path in which our robot will collide.

In this step, you will implement `path_collision_check_occupancy_grid` function which returns the `Segment` indices of the given `Path` which collides with any of the given obstacles. 
This function takes `Path` *t*, radius of the robot *r*, and list of obstacles as arguments. 
It returns the list of indices which represents the `Segment`s of the `Path` which collides with any of the obstacles.

#### Step 10: Collision Checking using R-Trees

The aim and all of the assumptions are same as `Step 8`. 
Like previous steps, the aim is to find the segments of the path in which our circular robot will collide. 
However, in this step you will use R-Tree to increase the execution time performance of your collision check module. 
R-Tree is an important optimization approach that is used in collision checking. 
For environments with high number of obstacles, it provides us an execution time decrease via its bounding box volume hierarchy structure. 
In this method, you will build an R-Tree of the given obstacles. 
You are free to implement your own R-Tree or you could use `STRTree` of `shapely` module.

In this step, you will implement `path_collision_check_r_tree` function which returns the `Segment` indices of the given `Path` which collides with any of the given obstacles. 
This function takes `Path` *t*, radius of the robot *r*, and list of obstacles as arguments. 
It returns the list of indices which represents the `Segment`s of the `Path` which collides with any of the obstacles.

#### Step 11: Collision Checking in Robot Frame

Raw sensor data are often given in the sensor frame of the robot. 
In this step, you receive the current pose of the robot and the next pose of the robot in global frame (planning done wrt to global frame), but the observed obstacles are given in the robot's frame. 
At each step, robot will observe the obstacles which are closer than 50 units in our 2D world.
The function needs to check if there is a collision during the movement of the robot until its next pose.

In this step, you will implement `collision_check_robot_frame` function which returns the *True* if robot will collide with any of the fixed obstacles during its movement until its next pose. 
This function takes radius of the robot *r*, current pose `SE2transform`, next pose `SE2transform`, and list of observed obstacles in robot frame as arguments. 

#### Step 12: Collision Checking via Safety Certificates

The aim and all of the assumptions are same as `Step 8`. 
Like previous steps, the aim is to find the segments of the path in which our circular robot will collide. 
However, in this step you will use a different optimization method called Safety Certificates. 
For environments with small number of obstacles but high number of points to be checked, it provides us an execution time decrease via the approach it uses on collision check. 
To obtain detailed information about the algorithm, you can check the part that is related to the safety certificates from the [given paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364915625345) (`Algorithm 1`). 
To calculate the distance between a point and an obstacle, you are allowed to use `shapely` module. 
Please note that you are only allowed to calcualte distance between two geometric primitives via `shapely`.

In this step, you will implement `path_collision_check_safety_certificate` function which returns the `Segment` indices of the given `Path` which collides with any of the given obstacles. 
This function takes `Path` *t*, radius of the robot *r*, and list of obstacles as arguments. 
It returns the list of indices which represents the `Segment`s of the `Path` which collides with any of the obstacles.

### Evaluation

For this exercise our performance metric is accuracy and execution time.
As test data, for each step random inputs are generated with the algorithm provided in `src/pdm4ar/exercises_def/ex06/data.py`. 
For each step, there are multiple test cases. 
The accuracies of steps 1-6 are calculated by the ratio of the correct answers. 
For the steps 6-11, List of indices are converted into a boolean list which represents whether there is a collision on each line segment of the path.
The accuracies of steps 6-11 are calculated by the average of the accuracy of test cases. 
Execution time of each step is calculated as an average of its test cases.
Lastly, accuracies ane execution times of each step are aggregated as weighted average.
